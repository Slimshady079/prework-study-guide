# Prework-Study-Guide

## Description

I felt inspired to make this program as it serves as a guide to other developers on what a basic website looks like. Even if you know nothing about coding, 
like me, this can still help you hit the ground running when it comes to developing a web app. It uses multiple different coding languages to help make the app
a little more intresting and complicated while simultaneously remaing simple.

## Installation
N/A

## Usage

This app contains differnt notes regarding specific coding languages that you can use as a guide to help you with your own website. 
Also, on windows, if you Right-click mouse button, and click inspect. Now click the console tab, this allows you to see the inner workings of Javascript. 
It also has a random topic generater that switches "which topic should we study first?" for anyone who may need help deciding or even to understand 
the coding behind such a thing.
